To create a TabLayout with three tabs in Android Studio using Java, add TabLayout and ViewPager to your activity_main.xml. Create three fragments (FragmentA, FragmentB, FragmentC) with their respective layouts. Set up a ViewPagerAdapter class extending FragmentPagerAdapter to manage the fragments. In MainActivity, initialize the ViewPager and TabLayout, and link them using tabLayout.setupWithViewPager(viewPager).
